Astrophysical Effects
=====================

Below are descriptions for each of the effects included in REBOUNDx.
Different implementations for the same effect are grouped together.
All effects follow the same recipes for usage, see the Python quick-start guide (:ref:`python_qs`) or C quick-start guide (:ref:`c_qs`).
Probably the quickest way to get up and running is to edit one of the linked examples for the effect you're interested in.

Orbit Modifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
REBOUNDx offers two ways of modifying orbital elements (semimajor axis/eccentricity/inclination damping, precession, etc.)
In both cases, each particle is assigned evolution timescales for each orbital element.  
Positive timescales correspond to growth / progression, negative timescales correspond to damping / regression.  
Semimajor axes, eccentricities and inclinations grow / damp exponentially.  
Pericenters and nodes progress/regress linearly.
