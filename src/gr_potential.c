 * 
 * This is the simplest potential you can use for general relativity.
 * It assumes that the masses are dominated by a single central body.
 * It gets the precession right, but gets the mean motion wrong by :math:`\mathcal{O}(GM/ac^2)`.  
 * It's the fastest option, and because it's not velocity-dependent, it automatically keeps WHFast symplectic.  
 * Nice if you have a single-star system, don't need to get GR exactly right, and want speed.
