 * This applies an inner disk edge that functions as a planet trap. Within its width the planet's migration is reversed by an opposite and roughly equal magnitude torque. Thus, stopping further migration and trapping the planet within the width of the trap. 
 * The functions here provide a way to modify the tau_a timescale in modify_orbits_forces, modify_orbit_direct, and type_I_migration.
 * Note that the present prescription is very useful for simple simulations when an inner trap is needed during the migration but it shouldn't be considered as a realistic model of the inner edge of a disk.
