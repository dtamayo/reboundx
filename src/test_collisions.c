 * ======================= ===============================================
 * Authors                 H. Rein 
 * Based on                None
 * C Example               :ref:`c_test_collisions`
 * ======================= ===============================================
 * 
 * This is a simple example implementation of a REBOUNDx collision module.
 * The outcome is similar to the built-in REBOUND function reb_collision_resolve_merge.
 * 
 * **Effect Parameters**
 * 
 * *None*
 * 
 * **Particle Parameters**
 * 
 * *None*
