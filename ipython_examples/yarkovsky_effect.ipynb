The Full Version can be used to get detailed calculations of the Yarkovsky effect on a particular body. However, it requires a large amount of parameters that may be difficult to find for a particular object. It also takes more computational time due to the large amount of equations that must be calaculated between each time step of the simulation. This version of the effect can be used to get accurate calculations on how a body is perturbed by the Yarkovsky effect.\n",
