# Changelog

This changelog only includes the most important changes in recent updates. For a full log of all changes, please refer to git.

### Version 4.5.0
* Fixed typo in Eggleton et al. 1998 to use half their acceleration from the spin-independent, conservative piece of the tidal potential (last term in their Eq 33)

### Version 4.4.2
* Fixed bug when resetting ODEs in tides_spin

### Version 4.4.1
* Added support for uv installation

### Version 4.4.0
* Added the ability to set the spin axis orientation to the gravitational harmonics (J2/J4) effect

### Version 4.3.0
* Added Gas Damping Forces effect

### Version 4.2.2
* Set path to local REBOUND installation when installing in editable mode

### Version 4.2.1
* Fixed clang error, remove commented code

### Version 4.2.0
* Removed wheels. Installation is now from source to avoid conflicts with different versions of REBOUND
* Fixed gr\_full errors when Simulation was not in center of mass frame. Convergence was also improved and effect is now a bit faster.
* Improvements to unit tests (now regenerate simulationarchives each time)

### Version 4.1.0
* Fixed inneredge effect
* Updated documentation and github actions

### Version 4.0.0
* Added support for REBOUND version 4.0.0

### Version 3.12.0
* Build REBOUNDx wheels for PyPI
* Updated unit tests

### Version 3.11.0
* Added Lense-Thirring effect

### Version 3.10.0
* Added Gas dynamical friction (Generozov \& Perets 2022)

### Version 3.9.3
* Added tides\_spin for dynamical tides and spin evolution (Lu et al. 2023)
